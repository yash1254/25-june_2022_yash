1)What is R.java file 
  =>Android R.java is an auto-generated file by aapt (Android Asset Packaging Tool) that contains 
    resource IDs for all the resources of res/ directory. If you create any component in the 
    activity_main.xml file, id for the corresponding component is automatically created in this file. 

2)what is activity and activity life cycle
=>#Activity->An activity provides the window in which the app draws its UI. This window typically 
             fills the screen, but may be smaller than the screen and float on top of other windows.
             Generally, one activity implements one screen in an app
 #Activity life cycle->Activity Lifecycle: Activity is one of the building blocks of Android OS. 
                       In simple words Activity is a screen that user interact with. Every Activity  
                       in android has lifecycle like created, started, resumed, paused, stopped or 
                       destroyed. These different states are known as Activity Lifecycle.

3)What is fragment and fragment life cycle in android 
=>#Fragment->A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its
             own input events. Fragments cannot live on their own--they must be hosted by an activity 
             or another fragment. The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the  
             host’s view hierarchy.
  #Fragment life cycle->Fragment life cycle is closely related to the life cycle of its host activity 
                        which means when the activity is paused, all the fragments available in the  
                        activity will also be stopped.A fragment can implement a behaviour that has
                        no user interface component.
